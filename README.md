# CTFs
This is a repo with summarized versions of my notes as well as photos of CTFs I work through.  Each CTF will have its own folder containing write-ups, screenshots, and any other useful artifacts. These notes are simplified for reference, but detailed enough to capture the methods and reasoning I used.
